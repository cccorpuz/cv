            As you have likely already read, my name is Crispin Corpuz and I am currently studying Electrical Engineering and Mathematics at the University of Nebraska at Omaha. I am also a recipient of the Walter Scott, Jr. "Scott Scholarship" here at UNO, which has given me countless leadership opportunities, professional development, personal guidance, and, most importantly, the opportunity to help others grow both through my own experiences and experiencing life with them as it comes. In this way, I have made numerous, meaningful, and lasting connections with absolutely amazing peers and professionals. I plan to graduate in the spring of 2023 with my Electrical Engineering degree from the University of Nebraska at Lincoln and my Mathematics degree from the University of Nebraska at Omaha. In the future, I intend to earn a PhD in Electrical Engineering, likely down the path of signal processing or communications. With this, I wish to either (or both, if I may be so bold) do research and development or teach undergraduate electrical engineering.
